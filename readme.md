## Description ##

* Creates a widget with the post's featured image, headline, excerpt, and link.
* To see the carousel of posts, you must have Twitter Bootstrap 3 and Glyphicons.
* Hides the widget if the post is a single post on the page. For example, if you are on the "Hello World" page, you won't see the widget with a preview of "Hello World."
* The carousel won't show posts that don't have an image.
